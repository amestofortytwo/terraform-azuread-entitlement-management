# This example contains a typical, basic deployment of an Entitlement Catalog, with an Access Package, an Assignment Policy, and AzureAD Groups used as resources.
# Most of the parameters and inputs are left to their default values, as they are typically the correct values in a common deployment.
# Refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/amestofortytwo/terraform-azuread-entitlement-management) for all available input parameters.
